* TTX

  The successor to the TTB Teletekst browser which broke due to some recent
  changes in the Teletekst website. TTB was in Python, but TTX is written in C.
  TTX is very young, but the basics work.

** providers

   TTB only supported the Dutch Teletekst system, but TTX aims to support other
   Teletekst providers as well. Currently supported:

   - Eins (German)
   - EÃ©n Teletekst (Belgian, Dutch)
   - HRT (Croatian)
   - MTV3 (Finnish)
   - NOS Teletekst (Dutch)
   - ORF (Austrian)
   - RAI Televideo (Italian)
   - RTP (Portuguese)
   - RTV (Slovenian)
   - YLE (Finnish)

   TTX is designed to make it easy to add other providers, esp. when they are
   mere variations of providers which are already supported. See
   =src/providers/=

** dependencies

   Just some very common libraries:

   - glib/gobject/gio
   - gtk+ 3.x
   - libsoup 2.4
   - libxml2
